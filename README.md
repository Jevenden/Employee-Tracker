## Description

Employee-Tracker is an app that uses a command-line interface to organize, record, and modify a company's employee database.

## Installation

This app requires node.js, inquirer, console.table, mysql2, and their assorted dependencies, all of which can be installed through NPM.

## Usage

After the necessary dependencies have been generated, open a new console and cd into the program directory. Activate mysql (mysql -u root -p) and enter your password. Afterwards either enter your own schema and seeds, or type source db/schema.sql, then db/seeds.sql.

Afterwards, simply type "node server.js" from the command line within the project folder to deploy the menu, then follow the prompts to fill or update your database.
